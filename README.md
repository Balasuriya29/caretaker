# CareTaker

## Description

* Caretaker is a web application made to make the doctors appointment from anywhere.
* It was my final project at the time of my Internship at TechVolt Software.
* At the pandemic, it was very difficult to see a doctor or to go to hosiptal to make an appointment.
* So, I thought of "why can't we make it through internet", and that is what caretaker is.
* Since Our internship was on Web Dev(Bootstrap), there is no back-end, I only completed all the design and client side validation



## Features

- Book an Appointment with a Doctor
- Donate or Request Blood
- Quick View of Hospital Around the User

(As said earlier, the data shown in the web app are static, there is no back-end database but every page is client side validated and responsive)
